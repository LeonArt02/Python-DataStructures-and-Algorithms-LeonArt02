    "A Doubly Linked List is a complex type of linked list where a node contains a pointer to the previous as well as th enext node in the sequence. Therefore, in a doubly-linked list, a node consists of three components: node data, pointer to the next node in node(next pointer), pointer to the former node (previous pointer).\n",
    "\n",
    "A doubly linked list has more efficient iteration, particularly if you need to ever iterate in reverse and more efficient deletion of particular nodes.\n",
