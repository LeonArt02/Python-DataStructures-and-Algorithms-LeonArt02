    "A **stack** is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements with two main operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Push**, which adds an element to the collection\n",
    "- **Pop**, which removes and returns the most recently added element\n",
    "\n",
    "The order in which an element added to or removed from a stack is descibed as **last in, first out**, referred to by the acronym **LIFO**.\n",
    "The most common example to explain this structure functioning to compare it to a stack of plates, in which adding or removing is only possible at the top\n",

    "The two most common approaches to **stack implementation** are using **Lists** or using **Linked Lists**\n",

    "### Stack Implementation using **Lists**\n",
    "In Python, we can use a list to implement a stack. The `append()` method is used for **push** (adding elements to the top), end the `pop()` method is used for pop (removing and returning elements from the top):\n",
