    "A tree data structure is a hierarchical structure that is used to represent and organize data in a way that is easy to navigate and search.\n",
    "It is a collection of nodes that are connected by **edges** and has a hierarchical relationship between the **nodes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The topmost node of the tree is called *root*, and the *nodes* below it are called the *child nodes*. Each node can have multiple child nodesm and these child nodes can also have their own child nodes, forming a recursive structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data structure is a specialized method to organize and store data in the computer to be used more effectively. It consists of a central node, structural nodes, and sub-nodes, which are connected via edges. We can also say that tree data structure has **roots**, **branches**, and leaves connected with one another.\n",

    "- **Parent Node**: The node which is a predecessor of a node is called the parent node of that node. \n",

    "- **Child Node**: The node which is the immediate successor fo a node is called the child node of that node.\n",
