    "\n",
    "An *algorithm* is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output in a finite amount of time.\n",
    "Algorithms are generally created independent of underlying languages, i.e. an algorithm can be implemented in more than one programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, suppose that you need to sort a sequence of numbers into monotonically increasing order. This problem arises frequently in practice and provides fertile ground for introducing many standard design techniques and analysis tools. Here is how we formally define the sorting problem:\n",
