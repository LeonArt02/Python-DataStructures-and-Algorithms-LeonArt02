    "An *algorithm* is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output in a finite amount of time.\n",
    "Algorithms are generally created independent of underlying languages, i.e. an algorithm can be implemented in more than one programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, suppose that you need to sort a sequence of numbers into monotonically increasing order. This problem arises frequently in practice and provides fertile ground for introducing many standard design techniques and analysis tools. Here is how we formally define the sorting problem:\n",

    "### 🔧 What are the Characteristics of an Algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "As one would not follow any written instructions to cook the recipe, but only the standard one. Similarly, not all written instructions for programming are an algorithm. For some instructions to be an algorithms, it must have the following characteristics:\n",
    "- **Clear and Unambiguous**: The algorithm should be unambiguous. Each of its steps should be clear in all aspects and must lead to only one meaning.\n",
    "- **Well-Defined Outputs**: If an algorithms says to take imputs, it should be well-defined inputs. It may or may not take input.\n",
    "- **Finite-ness**: The algorithm must be finite, i.e. it should terminate after a finite time.\n",
    "- **Feasible**: The algorithm must be simple, generic, and practica, such that it can be executed with the available resources. It must not contain some future technology or anything.\n",
    "- **Language Independent**: The Algorithm designed must be language-independent , i.e. it must be just plain instructions that can be implemented in any language, and yet the output will be the same, as expected.\n",
    "- **Input**: An algorithm has zero or more inputs. Each that contains a fundamental operator must accept zero or more inputs.\n",
    "- **Definiteness**: All instructions in an algorithm must be unambiguous, precise, and easy to interpret. By referring to any of the instructions in an algorithm one can clearly understand what is to be done. Everu fundamental operator in instructions must be defined without any amiguity.\n",
    "- **Effectiveness**: An algorithm must be developed by using very basic, simple, and feasible operations so that one can trace it out by using just paper and pencil.\n"
